## How it Works


1. Users connect their Ethereum wallet and choose an NFT they wish to bridge.

2. The NFT is locked on the Ethereum chain, ensuring it cannot be transferred while bridged.

3. A message is sent to the Aptos smart contract via Wormhole to mint a replica of the locked NFT.

4. On the Aptos blockchain, a replica of the NFT is created and transferred to the user's connected Aptos wallet.

5. If users wish to return the NFT to Ethereum, the replica on Aptos is burnt, and the original is unlocked and returned to their Ethereum wallet.

6. Aptos Pixel supports wallet connections via email accounts, simplifying the user experience.

## Potential Advantages

#### Cross-Chain Flexibility

Users can bridge their NFTs across chains, expanding the use cases and exposure of their assets beyond Ethereum.

#### Low-Cost and High-Speed

The Aptos blockchain offers fast transaction speeds and low fees, making it an attractive destination for NFT holders looking for efficient asset management.

## Revenue Model

Aptos Pixel generates revenue by charging a small fee for each cross-chain execution. When users bridge their NFTs between Ethereum and Aptos, a minimal fee is applied to the process, ensuring a sustainable business model while keeping costs low for users.
